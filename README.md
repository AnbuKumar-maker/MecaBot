# MecaBot
I am building a Mecannum Robot which can move in multiple directions and autonomously navigate a defined path A to path B without using LIDAR or Depth Camera. By using simple US100 Ultrasonic sensor, adding an array of 4 x 4 US100 sensors in all 4 directions of the bot using Arduino can achieve pre-defined path planning. Still this project is under fine tuning and experimentation
