Motors

The motors are arranged as follows (looking from the top) Back Right: Motor A Back Left: Motor B Front Right: Motor C Front Left: Motor D Some L298 driver boards jumper out the "Enable" pin for each motor channel. Refer to the documentation for your board and check if there is a jumper which needs to be removed. The "A" and "B" (or "1" and "2") inputs on the motor driver control the direction.

The "A" and "B" (or "1" and "2") inputs on the motor driver control the direction.

Connections for the motor driver are as follows:

Motor A (1)

A => 22

B => 24

Enable => 2

Motor B (2)

A => 26

B => 28

Enable => 3

Motor C (3)

A => 30

B => 31

Enable => 4

Motor D (4)

A => 32

B => 33

Enable => 5

The motor driver board outputs are normally labelled "+" and "-". Connect the positive and negative leads from the motors to the outputs.

If you compile the code with "BURN_IN" defined, the software will cycle through each motor in turn.
